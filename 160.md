# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

**Description**

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins

For example, the following two linked lists:

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3

```

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Notes:**

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

**Thinking Process**

1. The easy way is to use a hash set. After adding every listnode from list A to the set, the first element in list B that fails to add to the set is going to be target
2. The optimized way to solve it is to use two pointers
3. Traverse through List A and B at the same time one step at a time, whenever a list terminates, redirect it to the head of the other list. If they have intersections, the pointers will meet at the intersection. 

**Proof**

Assumptions: ListA has ***A*** nodes that are not in ListB, ListB has ***B*** nodes not in ListA. They have ***C*** nodes in common. By pointing the last node of each list to the other, it is guaranteed that both pointers must meet when after travelling ***A + B+ C***, which happens to be the exact location of the intersection of the two lists. 

**Code**

***Approach 1 (hash set)***

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        while(headA != null){
            set.add(headA);
            headA = headA.next;
        }
        while(headB != null){
            if(!set.add(headB))
                return headB;
            headB = headB.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

***Approach 2***

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode pa = headA;
        ListNode pb = headB;
        while(pa != pb){
            pa = (pa == null) ? headB : pa.next;
            pb = (pb == null) ? headA : pb.next;
        }
        return pa;
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Approach 1 has a space complexity O(m+n), and time complexity O(m+n)
2. Approach 2 has a space complexity O(1), and time complexity O(m+n)
