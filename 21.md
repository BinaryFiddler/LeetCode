# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

**Description**

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be make by splicing toether the nodes of the first two lists.

**Thinking Process**

1. The problem is essentially to implement the merge process in merge sort for linked list
2. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) for detailed explaination on merge sort

**Code**

```java
public class Solution{
  public ListNode mergeTwoSortedLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2){
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode head = dummy;
    
    while(l1 != null || l2 != null){
      int val1 = (l1 != null) ? l1.val : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      int val2 = (l2 != null) ? l2.val : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      if(val1 <= val2){
        head.next = l1;
        l1 = l1.next;
      }else{
        head.next = l2;
        l2 = l2.next;
      }
      head = head.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
  }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1)
2. Time complexity is O(n + m) since both lists are traversed exactly once
