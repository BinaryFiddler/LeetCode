# 387. First Unique Character in a String

**Description**

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

**Examples:**

```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.

```

**Note:** You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

**Thinking Process**

1. Scan through the string once, update the frequency of each character
2. Scan through the string another time, return the index if the character has a frequence of 1

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1) since we only use constant extra space
2. Time complexity is O(n) as the string is scanned twice
