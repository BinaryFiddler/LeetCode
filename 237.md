# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

**Description**

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node. Suppose the linked list is  `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` and you are given the third node with value `3`, the linked list should become `1 -> 2 -> 4` after calling your function.

**Thinking Process**

1. Since only the node-to-delete is given, we have to delete it by value (since we don't have access to the node before it)
2. Duplicate the value of ***node.next*** to ***node***, then delete ***node.next*** by linking ***node*** directly to ***node.next.next***

**Code**

```java
public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
}
```
**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1)
2. Time complexity is O(1) since it only requires 2 operations
