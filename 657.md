# 657. Judge Route Circle

**Description**

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to **the original place**.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L` (Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

**Thinking Process**

1. Keep track of the robots position in terms of x and y
2. Iterate through the moves, update x and y according to the move
3. Check if x = 0 and y = 0

**Code**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++){
            char c = moves.charAt(i);
            if(c == 'L'){
                x--;
            }else if(c == 'R'){
                x++;
            }else if(c == 'U'){
                y++;
            }else if(c == 'D'){
                y--;
            }
        }        
        return (x == 0 && y == 0);
    }    
}

```
