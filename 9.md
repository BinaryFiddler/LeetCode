# 9. Palindrome Number

**Description**

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space. 

**Thinking Process** [reference](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/8090/9-line-accepted-java-code-without-the-need-of-handling-overflow)

1. A palindrome number cannot be negative
2. A palindrome number cannot be multiples of 10 except that it is 0
3. To determine if a number is a palindrome we can reverse the number and compare with its original
4. To avoid overflowing when reversing the number, we can only reverse half of it. The result should equal to the other half or 10 times greater (integer operation).

**Code**

```java
public boolean is Palindrome(int x){
  //return false if x is negative or multiples of 10
  if(x < 0 || (x != 0 && x % 10 == 0))
    return false;
  int reverse = 0;
  //reverse the second half of x
  while(x > reverse){
    reverse = reverse * 10 + x % 10;
    x = x / 10;
  }
  return (x == reverse || x == reverse / 10); 
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1) since no additional data structure is used
2. Time complexity is O(log(n)) since the while loop terminates at the after O(log(n)) times
