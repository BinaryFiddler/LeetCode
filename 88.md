# 88. Merge Sorted Array

**Description**

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

**Note:**
You may assume that *nums1* has enough space (size that is greater or equal to *m* + *n*) to hold additional elements from *nums2*. The number of elements initialized in *nums1* and *nums2* are *m* and *n* respectively.

**Thinking Process**

1. At first glance, it's very similar to the merging process in merge sort. The trick is however without allocating extra space
2. If we merge from the front, the merged result will corrupt the original content in nums1
3. The trick is to merge from the back of the two arrays

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int pos = m + n - 1;
        while(m > 0 || n > 0){
            int val1 = m > 0 ? nums1[m - 1] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            int val2 = n > 0 ? nums2[n - 1] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            if(val1 >= val2){
                nums1[pos--] = val1;
                m--;   
            }else{
                nums1[pos--] = val2;
                n--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Time complexity is O(m+n)
2. Space complexity is O(n)
