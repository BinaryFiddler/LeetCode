# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

**Description**

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

```

**Example:**

```
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
```

**Code**

```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        int num = low + (high - low) / 2;
        while(guess(num) != 0){
            if(guess(num) == 1){
                low = num + 1;
            }else{
                high = num;
            }
            num = low + (high - low) / 2;
        }
        return num;
    }
}
```
