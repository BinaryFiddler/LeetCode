# 136. Single Number

Given an array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Thinking Process**

1. Use XOR to add up all the numbers in the array
2. Numbers appears in pair will cancel out to 0, leaving the single element behind

```Java
public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
    int singleNum = 0;
    for(int n : nums){
        singleNum ^= n;
    }
    return singleNum;
}
```
**Complexity**

1. Time complexity is O(n) by scanning the array once
2. Space complexity is O(1) without using additional data structrues
