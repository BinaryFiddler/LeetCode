# 605. Can Place Flowers

**Description**

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number **n**, return if **n**new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False

```

**Note:**

1. The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
2. The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
3. **n** is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

**Thinking Process**

1. This is a greedy problem
2. Scan the flowerbed from left to right Plot a flower whenever we have a chance

**Code**

```java
public class Solution{
  public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n){
    for(int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++){
      if(flowerbed[i] == 0){
        int prev = i == 0 ? 0 : flowerbed[i - 1];
        int next = i == flowerbed.length - 1 ? 0 : flowerbed[i + 1];
        if(prev + next == 0){
          n--;
          flowerbed[i] = 1;
        }
      }
    }
    return n < 1;
  }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Time complexity is O(n)
2. Space complexity is O(1)
