# 19. Remove Nth Node from End of List

**Description**

Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head. 

For example,

```java
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Thinking Process**

1. Using two pointers ***slow, fast***, that are separate by n elements
2. ***slow*** will eventually points to the element before the to-be-removed element when ***fast == null*** (fast has traversed the entire list)

**Code**

```java
public class Solution{
  public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head){
    ListNode slow = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode fast = head;
    ListNode dummy = slow;
    slow.next = head;
    //separate fast and slow by n elements
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
      if(fast != null)
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    //move slow to the element just in front of the target
    while(fast != null){
      slow = slow.next;
      fast = fast.next;
    }
    //remove the target element
    slow.next = slow.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
  }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1)
2. Time complexity is O(n) since the list will be traversed twice at most (by both two pointers combined)
