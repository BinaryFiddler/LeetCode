# 409. Longest Palindrome

**Description**

Given a string which consists of lowercase and uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example: **

```java
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Thinking Process**

1. A palindrome can contain at most 1 character that appears odd number of times
2. The simple way of doing it is to use a hash table to keep track of each character's appearance. 
3. The optimized way is to use a hashset, every time a character reappears, increment the length of the longest palindrome by 2 and remove that character from the set. By the end of the loop, check if there's any left over in the set (they are the letters that appears odd number of times), add 1 to the length of the palindrome if there is.

**Code**

```Java
public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
   Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
   int len = 0;
   
   for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
       char c = s.charAt(i);
       if(set.contains(c)){
           len += 2;
           set.remove(c);
       }else
           set.add(c);
   }
   
   return set.size() > 0 ? len + 1 : len;
}
```
**Complexity**

1. Time complexity is O(n) since the string is scanned exactly once
2. Space complexity can be upto O(n) (if the string is composed of non-repeating characters)
