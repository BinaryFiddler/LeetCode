# 268. Missing Number

**Description**

Given an array containing *n* distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,
Given *nums* = `[0, 1, 3]` return `2`

**Thinking Process**

1. Note that the range of the number in the array is from 0 - n, while the length of the array is n - 1
2. The elements of the array are indexed from 0 - (n-1)
3. XOR every element of the array, and XOR numbers from 0 - n. 
4. Non-missing element will XOR with its equivalent index to 0, the remainder of the result is the missing number

```java
public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
	int missing = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<nums.length + 1; i++){
        missing ^= i;
        if(i == nums.length)
            continue;
        else
            missing ^= nums[i];
    }
    return missing;
}
```
**Complexity**

1. The array is scanned once, time complexity is O(n)
2. No extra storage is required, space complexity is O(1)
