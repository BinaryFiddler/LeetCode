# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

**Description**

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Thinking Process**

1. Iterate the array, keep track of the minimum value so far
2. Assume we are selling on day i, the max profits for selling on day i would be prices[i] - minSoFar

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Time complexity is O(n)
2. Space complexity is O(1)
