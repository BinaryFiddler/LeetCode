# 191. Number of 1 Bits

**Description**

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.

**Thinking Process**

1. Shift the number to the right 1 bit at a time and perform an & with 1

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n != 0){
            count += (n & 1);
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
