# 371. Sum of Two Integers

**Description**

Calculate the sum of two integers *a* and *b*, but you are **not allowed** to use the operator `+` and `-`.

**Example:**
Given *a* = 1 and *b* = 2, return 3.

**Thinking Process**

1. At each iteration, calculate the carry bits and the addition result(with no carry) separately
2. At next iteration, shift the carry result from last iteration left by 1 and add it to the addition result

```Java
public int getSum(int a, int b) {
    //store result in a, store carry in b
    while(b != 0){
        int carry = a & b;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = carry << 1;
    }
    return a;
}
```
