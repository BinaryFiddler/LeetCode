# 382. Linked List Random Note

**Description**

Given a singly linked list, return a randome node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probablity of being chosen. 

**Follow up:**
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

**Example:**

```
// Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
Solution solution = new Solution(head);

// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
solution.getRandom();
```

**Thinking Process**

1. It's a typical reservoir sampling problem [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling)

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    Random rand;
    ListNode head;
    /** @param head The linked list's head.
        Note that the head is guaranteed to be not null, so it contains at least one node. */
    public Solution(ListNode head) {
        rand = new Random();
        this.head = head;
    }
    /** Returns a random node's value. */
    public int getRandom() {
        ListNode copy = head;
        int value = copy.val;
        int count = 1;
        while(copy != null){
            value = (rand.nextInt(count) + 1 == 1) ? copy.val : value;
            copy = copy.next;
            count++;
        }
        return value;
    }
}
```
**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1) since no addtional data structures are used
2. Time complexity for each ***getRandom()*** call is O(n) as the list have to traversed once
