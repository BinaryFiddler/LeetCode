# 557. Reverse Words in a String III

**Description**

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**

```Java
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Note:** In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

**Thinking Process**

1. Scan through the string, find sections of the string that need reversing and reverse them

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        char[] sentence = s.toCharArray();
        int start = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < sentence.length; i++){
            if(sentence[i] == ' '){
                if(start != -1){
                    reverse(sentence, start, i-1);
                    start = -1;
                }
            }
            else{
                if(start == -1){
                    start = i;
                }else if(i == sentence.length - 1){
                    reverse(sentence, start, i);
                }
            }
        }
        return new String(sentence);
    }
    
    void reverse(char[] sentence, int from, int to){
        while(from < to){
            char temp = sentence[from];
            sentence[from++] = sentence[to];
            sentence[to--] = temp;
        }
    }
}

```

**Complexity**

1. Time complexity is O(n) as the string is scanned at most twice (everything must be reversed)
2. Space complexity is O(n)
