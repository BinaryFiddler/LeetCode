# 263. Ugly Number

**Description**

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. 

Ugly numbers are postive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor which is 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number

**Thinking Process**

1. The question is straightforward (no tricks at all)

**Code**

```java
public class Solution{
  public boolean isUgly(int num){
    if(num < 1)
      return false;
  	if(num == 1)
      return true;
    while(num != 1){
      num = num % 2 == 0 ? num / 2 : num;
      num = num % 3 == 0 ? num / 3 : num;
      num = num % 5 == 0 ? num / 5 : num;
	  if(num % 2 != 0 && num % 3 != 0 && num % 5 != 0)
        break;
    }
    return num == 1;
  }
}
```
