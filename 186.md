# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

**Description**

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always seperated by a single space.

For example,
Given s = "`the sky is blue`",
return "`blue is sky the`".

**Thinking Process**

1. Reverse the entire string character by character
2. Reverse each words in the reversed string character by character

**Code**

```java
public class Solution {
    public void reverseWords(char[] s) {
        reverse(s, 0, s.length - 1);
        //reverse each words
        int start = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
            if(s[i] == ' '){
                reverse(s, start, i - 1);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
      	//reverse the last word
        reverse(s, start, s.length-1);
    }
    
    void reverse(char[] s, int from, int to){
        while(from < to){
            char temp = s[from];
            s[from++] = s[to];
            s[to--] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

**Complexity**

1. Space complexity is O(1)
2. Time complexity is O(n) as the char array is reversed at most twice
