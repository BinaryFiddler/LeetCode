# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description**

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters

**Examples:**

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a **substring**, `"pwke"` is a *subsequence* and not a substring.

**Thinking Process**

1. Use a hash table to store the most recent occurence of each character
2. Save the index（denote as k）of the most recent repeating character, the substring must start from k
3. Update k and maxLen as we scan through the array

**Remark**

1. Convert the indexing system to 1-based instead of 0-based to include corner case of a string with only a single character

```Java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    int maxLen = 0;
    int lastRepeatingIndex = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
        char c = s.charAt(i);
        if(map.containsKey(c)){
            lastRepeatingIndex = Math.max(map.get(c), lastRepeatingIndex);
        }
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - lastRepeatingIndex + 1);
        map.put(c, i + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLen;
}
```

**Complexity**

1. The string is scanned once, time complexity is O(n).
2. Space complexity is O(n) as a result of using hash table.
